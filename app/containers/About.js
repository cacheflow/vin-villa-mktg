              On April 29th, 1992 in Los Angeles, CA, the very same day of
              the notorious Rodney King riots, <strong>Vin Villa</strong> was
              born. A Los Angeles riot in his own right, Vin is a master of his craft
              who provides listeners with polished songwriting, eloquent
              vocals, and melodic production.<br/><br/>
              Raised in <strong>Long Beach</strong>, Vin faced various obstacles.
              Growing up surrounded by the gang culture of Los Angeles exposed him
              to the social stratification of the City of Angels. Vin has decided
              to use his interpretations of growing up in Los Angeles as inspiration
              for his works.<br/><br/>        
              At the age of 12, he began writing lyrics as a way of expressing
              his daily life. After years of hard work and practice, Vin built
              his home studio where his production and engineering skills began
              to thrive and grow. Not only was he crafting beats, but he also
              began mixing and mastering his sessions. Vin’s body of work
              includes various projects, most notably his mixtapes <strong>Finally,
              Victory Is Necessary, and CApable</strong>.<br/><br/>
              Life changed forever in the summer of 2012 when Vin received
              a letter of acceptance to the <strong>University of Southern California</strong>.
              Capitalizing on this tremendous opportunity, Vin
              earned his Bachelor's Degree with a major in <strong>American Studies
            </strong> and minor in <strong>Music Industry</strong> in December 2014.

              Thanks to years of hard work and dedication, his songwriting
              and production skills have afforded him opportunities to work
              with <strong>Juicy J, Rapper Big Pooh, Taje, and Melat</strong>. The charismatic
              youth from humble beginnings has been cosigned by well-known
              industry producers, <strong>THX (of Drop City Yacht Club) and Ric Rude
              (Destiny’s Child – Cater 2 U)</strong>. Long Beach native and legendary
              rapper <strong>Warren G</strong> has given his nod of approval when the two
              freestyled together during a chance meeting at a recording studio.
              A gifted performer, Vin has recently rocked shows at the Terrace,
              The Key Club, The M Bar, Cal State Long Beach, and USC. He has
              opened up for artists such as <strong>Casey Veggies, Raekwon,
              and Tech N9ne's Strange Music affiliates Ces Cru</strong>.<br/><br/>
              Since becoming a college grad, Vin has turned his full focus
              towards his music career with <strong>FOREVER.FREEDOM.DREAMING</strong> set to
              drop late 2015.<br/><br/>
              His goal is simple: be successful while making the music that
              has saved his life. He will continue to create, exercise his
              gifted musicianship and will not cease until he’s reached a
              level of notoriety comparable to the legends that have done
              so before him. Vin Villa is a name that <strong>won’t soon be forgotten.</strong>
